Paste into a terminal:

python << END
import time
i = 0
while True:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        i+= 1
        print('Before Continue: i =', i)
        if i > 5:
                continue
        print('After Continue: i =', i)
END

Output:
Before Continue: i = 1
After Continue: i = 1
Before Continue: i = 2
After Continue: i = 2
Before Continue: i = 3
After Continue: i = 3
Before Continue: i = 4
After Continue: i = 4
Before Continue: i = 5
After Continue: i = 5
Before Continue: i = 6
Before Continue: i = 7
Before Continue: i = 8
